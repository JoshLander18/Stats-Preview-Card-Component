## Overview

Whew,

This was my first ever Frontend Mentor Challenge. Funnily enough, the hardest part wasn't actually coding the design, but actually getting it hosted lol. It took me quite a well to get used to GitHub's repository system and publish via Netlify (2/half hrsðŸ˜­), but I eventually prevailed.

I have been practising CSS for what seems like a year now. So this challenge felt pretty comfortable as I knew the basic CSS Flexbox and Grid functionalities. Also had lots of fun doing as well :)
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
